Cyber Security J Component -- Implementation of bifid cipher in cloud computing

## Research Paper

MATLAB-Based Software Tool for Implementation of Bifid Ciphers

## Abstract

Cloud Storage is a service where data is remotely maintained,
managed, and backed up. The service allows the users to store files
online, so that they can access them from any location via the Internet.
In recent days, almost everyone is moving towards cloud storage and
cloud computing, According to a recent survey conducted with more than
800 business decision makers and users worldwide, the number of
organizations gaining competitive advantage through high cloud
adoption has almost doubled in the last few years and by 2017, the
public cloud services market is predicted to exceed $244 billion.
People in their daily life use cloud storage for saving their private
data. Hence, need for the data to be secured is much more than the
same in case of local storage. There are concerns with the safety and
privacy of important data stored remotely. Any compromise in data will
automatically destroy the privacy, which is the fundamental right for
human beings.

## Why BIFID?

Bifid is a Lightweight Encryption Algorithm for Secure data transfer
and storage.
The shortcomings of the cloud and IoT in terms of constrained
devices are highlighted. There in fact exist some lightweight
cryptography algorithms that does not always exploit security-efficiency
trade-offs
Therefore, we chose our topic to be security in storage and data-
flow in cloud storage and cloud computing using this Algorithm. We
hope our efforts in this project will be benefitial to society and
public who have completely shifted their usage/storage/buisness to
cloud computing.
